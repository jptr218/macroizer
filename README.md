### Do you ever find yourself doing the same repetitive task over and over again? Well in that case, I've made a simple macro recorder and player for Windows. Enjoy!
## Macroizer can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jptr218/lumberjack/raw/main/lumberjack.exe) (you need to unzip it)
### Usage:

### `macroizer record [macro]`
### `macroizer play [macro]`
### `macroizer clear [macro]`
